❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

📌 Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction System is a Machine Learning–based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, heart rate, and other clinical features. The goal of this project is to assist in early detection and preventive healthcare using data-driven techniques.
🎯 Objectives

To analyze patient health data and identify risk factors
To build a predictive model for heart disease detection
To assist healthcare professionals in decision making
To demonstrate the use of Machine Learning in medical diagnosis

🧠 Technologies Use
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a heart disease dataset containing medical attributes such as:
Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Level
Fasting Blood Sugar
Resting ECG Results
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Exercise Induced Angina
ST Depression
Number of Major Vessels
Thalassemia

⚙️ Machine Learning Approach
The project follows these steps:
Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Selection
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Prediction
Common algorithms that can be used:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/naharaarushi/heart-prediction-disease.git
Navigate to the project folder
cd heart-prediction-disease
Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook or Python file
jupyter notebook

📈 Results

The trained model predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on input medical parameters. The system helps in early risk assessment and can support preventive healthcare strategies.
📌 Future Enhancements
